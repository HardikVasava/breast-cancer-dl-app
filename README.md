# ü©∫ Breast Cancer Diagnostics DL App

This project predicts whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using a deep learning model trained on breast cancer diagnostic data. The model is built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify tumors based on extracted features. The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, a Power BI dashboard for business insights, and deploying a prediction API with Flask. The frontend is created using ReactJS with Axios for API integration and styled with TailwindCSS.

## üìÇ Dataset

This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset containing numeric features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image and are used to classify tumors as benign or malignant.

The dataset can be found in public repositories such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- Handling missing or irrelevant data (if any)  
- Dropping target variable from input features  
- Scaling features using MinMaxScaler for normalization  
- Splitting data into training and test sets  

---

## ü§ñ 3. Model Training (TensorFlow)

- Sequential neural network model with:  
  - Input layer receiving scaled features  
  - Two hidden layers with ReLU activation and dropout for regularization  
  - Output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification (benign or malignant)  
- Model compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer  
- Training with early stopping to prevent overfitting  
- Validation performed on test data

## üåê 5. Flask Server

- Loads the trained model and scaler on startup  
- Provides REST API endpoint `/predict` for predictions  
- Accepts JSON input of diagnostic features, scales data, runs prediction  
- Returns predicted class (benign=0, malignant=1) and optionally prediction probability  

---

## üíª 6. React Client

- Form interface for users to input diagnostic features  
- Axios used to send data to Flask backend and receive prediction  
- Displays prediction result clearly to users  
- Responsive design styled using TailwindCSS for clean and modern look

## üìà 7. Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

- Interactive charts showing benign vs malignant cases  
- Feature importance insights based on correlation and model coefficients  
- Confusion matrix and classification performance visuals  
- Drill-down capabilities for different feature groupings  

DAX Measures Used:

Diagnosis = IF('CancerData'[benign_0__mal_1] = 1, "Malignant", "Benign")

Total Patients = COUNTROWS('CancerData')

Total Malignant = CALCULATE([Total Patients], 'CancerData'[Diagnosis] = "Malignant")

Malignancy Rate = DIVIDE([Total Malignant], [Total Patients])

Visuals Included:

- Card Visuals showing total patients, malignant cases, malignancy rate  
- Donut Chart displaying benign vs malignant distribution  
- Stacked Bar Chart visualizing diagnostic feature trends  
- Data Table with computed diagnosis  
- Slicer for interactive filtering  

Insights:

- Understand class imbalance  
- Identify patterns in key diagnostic features  
- Filter and drill down into case groups  
- Highlight outliers or anomalies  
- Enhance interpretability of model outcomes  

Power BI report files located in `power-bi/` folder.

## üß™ Sample Prediction

Given diagnostic input features such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension:

- The model predicts the tumor class:  
  - 0 = Benign  
  - 1 = Malignant  

- The API returns the predicted class along with the confidence of the prediction.
